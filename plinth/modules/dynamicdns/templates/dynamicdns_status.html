        NAT type not detected yet, if you do not provide a "IP check
        URL" we will not detect a NAT type.

          Behind NAT, this means that dynamic DNS service will poll
          the "IP check URL" for changes (we need the "IP check URL"
          for this reason - otherwise we will not detect IP changes).
          It may take up to {{ timer }} minutes until we update your
          DNS entry in case of WAN IP change.
