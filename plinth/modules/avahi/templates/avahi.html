<h2>Service Discovery</h2>

<p>Service discovery allows other machines on the network to discover
  your FreedomBox and services running on it.  It also allows
  FreedomBox to discover other machines and services running on your
  local network.  Service discovery is not essential and works only on
  internal networks.  It may be disabled to improve security
  especially when connecting to a hostile local network.</p>
