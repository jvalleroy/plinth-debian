  <h2>{% trans "SIP Server (repro)" %}</h2>

  <p>
    {% blocktrans trimmed %}
      repro provides various SIP services that a SIP softphone can utilize to
      provide audio and video calls as well as presence and instant messaging.
      repro provides a server and SIP user accounts that clients can use to let
      their presence known.  It also acts as a proxy to federate SIP
      communications to other servers on the Internet similar to email.
    {% endblocktrans %}
  </p>

  <p>
    {% blocktrans trimmed %}
      To make SIP calls, a client application is needed. Available clients
      include <a href="https://jitsi.org/">Jitsi</a> (for computers) and
      <a href="https://f-droid.org/repository/browse/?fdid=com.csipsimple">
        CSipSimple</a> (for Android phones).
    {% endblocktrans %}

      <strong>Note:</strong>  Before using repro, domains and users will need
      to be configured using the <a href="/repro/domains.html">web-based
      configuration panel</a>. Users in the <em>admin</em> group will be able
      to log in to the repro configuration panel. After setting the domain, it
      is required to restart the repro service. Disable the service and
      re-enable it.
